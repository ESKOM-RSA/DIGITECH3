This is how a program is set out:

FIRST: Multiline comment giving name, author, purpose, version number, date
e.g 

'''
  GUESSING GAME (v.01)
   Sam McGuire,  2023
   The purpose of this game is to guess a number between 1 and 100.  The computer
   will create a list of number you have guessed and will tell you when you are
   getting hotter or colder
   '''

   SECOND: 
   import any libraries that are part of python
   import any third party libraries

   e.g
   import OS
   import random

   THIRD:
   Set variables and CONSTANTS
   int_score = 0
   CONSTANT_VAR = 100 
   #constant variables are ones that are not change by the user and 
   #stay the same during the who program

   FOURTH:
   Creating definitions and classes

   FIFTH:
   Running the definitions and class (often within a loop to create a play again or run until situation).
